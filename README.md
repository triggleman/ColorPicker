# ColorPicker

ColorPicker is a simple Javascript project that allows a user to change the background by choosing from the following squares.
The useer can change the background as many times as they choose too.

##Future Plans

I would like to incorperate  more functionality to the project and allow the user to choose from a vast of different colors.
